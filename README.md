# Final-Project

conducted in collaboration with the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), focuses on predictive maintenance for generators, integrating advanced AI algorithms and audio sensor technology. A robust machine learning model was developed to accurately predict the remaining lifespan of generators. This project showcases expertise in data analysis and AI implementation, highlighting innovative capabilities in critical industrial applications. We used the tensorflow library. The work is carried out in a Google Collab work environment.
